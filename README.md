Technical test for the Front-end position

## CHALLENGE

**Context:** We would like you to build a small responsive web application to test your knowledge of Front End Development and related technologies.

- Deployment of the web app on Netlify from your Git repository using the New Site from Git workflow

### API

The web application must request data to the Hackers News public API. 

### FUNCTIONALITY

The selected filter should persist on the local storage
- The favorited posts should persist on the local storage
- The web app is expected to work as a responsive web application
- When clicking on the row, a new tab should be open with the link of the post (story_url)
